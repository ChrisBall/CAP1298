# CAP1298
Arduino library for use with a CAP1298 capacitive sensing IC. 
Tested with an UNO on the SOIC version of the chip. 
Release behaviour is flaky, but this could be due to the design of the chip itself. Also, this is one of the few libraries I've programmed, so it could stand to be improved - fork it!
